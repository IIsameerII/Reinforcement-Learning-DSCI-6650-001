# Reinforcement Learning - Assignement 1

This repository includes two Jupyter notebooks designed for conducting reinforcement learning experiments of Assignment - 1. The notebooks utilize several agent models and contexts.

## Notebooks

1. **a1q1.ipynb**: This notebook contains experiments with various reinforcement learning models in stationary environments as mentioned in question 1.
2. **a1q2.ipynb**: This notebook contains experiments with various reinforcement learning models in non-stationary environments as mentioned in question 2.

## Requirements

To run these notebooks, you need the following:

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- The following Python packages:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

You can install the necessary packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib jupyter
```

## Running the Notebooks

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IIsameerII/Reinforcement-Learning-DSCI-6650-001
   cd https://github.com/IIsameerII/Reinforcement-Learning-DSCI-6650-001
   ```
2. **Start Jupyter Notebook**:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. **Open the Notebooks**:

   Within the Jupyter Notebook interface, locate the directory that contains the notebooks (`a1q1.ipynb` and `a1q2.ipynb`) and proceed to open them.
4. **Run the Notebooks**:

   Run the tests by executing the cells in the notebooks in a sequential manner. The notebooks are specifically built to execute the essential code for each experiment, encompassing environment configuration, agent initialization, and experiment execution.
